                    # Panel data contain observations of multiple characteristics measured over time for the same set of subjects, such as people, businesses, or countries (cpu cores).
                    For panel data, you need a time value and an additional characteristic to identify a particular observation. For example, if you have panel data that tracks sales for a group of companies over time, youâ€™ll need a time value and a company identifier to find an individual observation.

Cross-sectional data describes a set of people, items, companies, etc. at a single point in time. The goal is to determine the differences between the subjects at one time.
Wikipedia: Time series and cross-sectional data can be thought of as special cases of panel data that are in one dimension only (one panel member or individual for the former, one time point for the latter).
-- balanced panel (each panel member is observed every periode) and unbalanced:
