# open-field
The Promouseus open-field system for IT infrastructure landscaping.


IT infrastructure is moving from on-premisses/single service provider setups to a combination of cloud, all kinds of “as a Service” concepts and appliance providers.

To control and harvest the power of these new hybrid IT infrastructure Promouseus is working on the open-field project. At Promouseus we like to compare IT infrastructure with a piece of cropland or common land that is the foundation to build your crops or IT services on. In medieval times little land was owned by the user. The [Open-field system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-field_system) rented land to a user that had the control and harvest ability over it but had to pay rent in return.

The Promouseus open-field project aims to become the foundation to control your IT landscape with an out-of-the-box user and programming interface.

##User interface
The web-based user interface is focuses on end-users in small businesses.

##Programming interface
The programming interface is created to allow company’s with a deeper understanding of IT to connect the user interface to there own infrastructure services. For example: ISP’s are using Promouseus open-field to allow there users (customers) to manage there internet connections and firewall settings.

##Project status
Currently we are rebuilding all infrastructure tools, concepts and idea’s that we created in the last 20 years to the open-field project. All current code is draft. At the end of 2017 we expect to launch the first out-of-the-box version with an installer included.
